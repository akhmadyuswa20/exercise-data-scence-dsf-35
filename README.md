# Iris flower data set used for multi-class classification
## Iris Flower Dataset
The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems.It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

This dataset became a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as Decision Tree

## Content
The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes - Petal Length, Petal Width, Sepal Length, Sepal width and Class(Species).

## Project Goals
The Iris classification project using the Iris flower data set used for multi-class classification Dataset has several important goals to build a machine learning model that will predict the reliability of an iris flower based on their specific features. Here are some of the main goals:

1. Building a iris classification model using the Decision Tree Algorithm
2. Analyze iris plant characteristics with good accuracy
3. Visualize data using the Decision Tree Algorithm with the model that has been created and with good accuracy
